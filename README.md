# Colour Calandar

Colour calendar is an organisation planner where the user can input their timetable, the calendar will then overlay a colour filter overtop the entire monitor for the duration of a task, upon transition the colour of the filter will switch and a popup will inform the user that the task they are supposed to be performing is changing, the benefits of this is that the colour change is a reminder of the intended task throughout the duration of it, also if the user was away from the computer, when they return they will notice the colour change and consult their timetable. Disadvantages of this include that the user may not have all of their tasks at their computer meaning they wont be exposed to this planner for most of their scheduled tasks. In this case a different planner would obviously be preferable. 

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* Further my experience in WPF programs.
* To personalise my user experience allowing my to track my time more effectively.
* To improve my utilisation of Win32 DLLs.
* An intruiging experiment in productivity to see if organising excercises by colour proves useful in seeing when tasks begin and end.

## Potential Risks
The colour changes over time may cause eye strain, not reccommended for those who suffer with migraines. I don't have any confirmation that it's actually a hazard but I'm concerned since it seems to prompt them in myself during debugging so I might be creating a health hazard. Proceed with caution.
